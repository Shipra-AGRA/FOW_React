-config driven UI- when our website is driven by data i.e controlling the UI using data(config) and this config from backend.

-two types of export -> named export and default export

-whenever a state variable updates, react re-renders the component

-react uses reconciliation algorithm(also known as react fiber algo). it is the way of find the diff and updating the DOM.

-virtual DOM is the visual representation of actual DOM.

-separation of concerns or single responsibility principle where each service has its own job no one is interfering each other, this is known as microservice architecture and here each service can be written in different languages.
all the services are deployed on different ports and all these ports can be mapped to domain name. so for making call to different service, need to make call to different url's.
ex- 1234-/ 
    1000-/api
    2000-/sms

-loads->api call->render on UI
-loads->render UI->make api call->re-render UI  [always use this approach atleast we can see the skeleton]

-useEffect Hook is called after the UI renders. when the component will load, it will render the component and when this render cycle is finish it will call the callback function passed in useEffect.

-for debugging purpose go to inspect>sources>put a debugger.

-we cannot make call to swiggy's api due to CORS policy as swiggy blocked the localhost to make request to the api but we can do this by add a chrome extension "cors chrome extension".

-shimmer UI-> resembles the actual page UI until UI does not loads.
